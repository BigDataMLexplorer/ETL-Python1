# Note: The connection URL is a dummy for illustration purposes

# Base class for our database models

# Additional comments:
# - 'create_engine' initializes the connection to the database.
# - 'Session' class is used to manage transactions.
# - 'declarative_base' is used to create a base class for our data models.
# - The connection URL structure is: 'database+driver://username:password@host:port/database_name'
# - Ensure to replace the 'db_connection_url' with your actual database connection details.
